## Module 8: 2D Animation & Reflection

For this assignment, I built a collision-based 2D animation using C++ and OpenGL. I created a vibrant and interactive simulation where colored balls are launched using the spacebar and react to reflective or destructible bricks. A manually controlled paddle (yellow brick) at the bottom lets users redirect the motion of the balls, adding engagement and challenge.

### üõ†Ô∏è Design and Development
I used a class-based design for both bricks and circles, applying object-oriented principles. I learned how to implement user input with arrow keys and spacebar, and how to add simple physics like directional changes on collision. I added different collision behaviors, color changes, and randomized properties to give the animation visual variety and interactivity.

### üí° Takeaway
This project helped reinforce my understanding of animation loops, event-driven input, and graphical feedback. I practiced clean code formatting and modular logic. These skills will directly help me in future software projects‚Äîespecially in game development, simulation programming, or visual UI work in my software engineering journey.
