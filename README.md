## Module 8: 2D Animation & Reflection

For this assignment, I built a collision-based 2D animation using C++ and OpenGL. I created a vibrant and interactive simulation where colored balls are launched using the spacebar and react to reflective or destructible bricks. A manually controlled paddle (yellow brick) at the bottom lets users redirect the motion of the balls, adding engagement and challenge.

### 🛠️ Design and Development
I used a class-based design for both bricks and circles, applying object-oriented principles. I learned how to implement user input with arrow keys and spacebar, and how to add simple physics like directional changes on collision. I added different collision behaviors, color changes, and randomized properties to give the animation visual variety and interactivity.

### 💡 Takeaway
This project helped reinforce my understanding of animation loops, event-driven input, and graphical feedback. I practiced clean code formatting and modular logic. These skills will directly help me in future software projects—especially in game development, simulation programming, or visual UI work in my software engineering journey.

## 🧠 How do I approach designing software?
When designing software, I begin by visualizing both functionality and user experience. For this 3D and 2D graphics project, I focused on modularity, simplicity, and interactivity. I broke down the problem into classes for bricks and circles, which helped me manage features like collision behavior and object state.

## 🎨 What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
This project helped me craft stronger object-oriented design skills and improved how I map real-world interactions (like bouncing or breaking) into code logic.

## 🔄 What design process did you follow for your project work?
I followed an iterative design process—starting with a basic framework, then layering in color, input controls, collision mechanics, and physics rules step by step.

## 🚀 How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
In the future, I can apply this incremental, feedback-driven design approach to any interactive system, whether it’s a game, data visualization, or UI prototype.

## 💻 How do I approach developing programs?
When developing programs, I like to build small, test frequently, and expand once stable.

## 🧱 What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
For the 3D scene, I learned how to implement camera movement, lighting, and texture mapping. For the 2D animation, I applied real-time input and basic physics.

## 🔁 How did iteration factor into your development?
Iteration played a huge role—I refined textures, fixed logic bugs, and improved interactivity with every milestone.

## 📈 How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones?
My confidence in debugging and modular code organization grew significantly.

## 🎯 How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
Studying computational graphics has given me transferable skills in visualization, simulation, and interaction—all essential in careers involving UI/UX, software engineering, and game development.

## 🧩 How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
They taught me how to make complex systems feel intuitive, visual, and interactive—an asset in both teaching and learning technical topics.

## 💼 How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?
It deepened my appreciation for how code can bring digital art and concepts to life, which will influence both my educational and professional journey going forward.
